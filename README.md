# Maps

The randomly generated maps are included since different run would lead to different maps due to the randomness. The rotated maps used in some notebooks are based on the random maps. They are not included. The Zernike maps can be easily generated. They are not included.

ETM05_S1_finesse and xITM_11_R1_Figure_finesse are also included as aLIGO measured maps. ETM05_S1_finesse is used for map decomposition and layer coefficients calculation, which is used to generate the random maps. xITM_11_R1_Figure_finesse is used in maps with increasing astigmatism.
